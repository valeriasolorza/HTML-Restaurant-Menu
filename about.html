        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to ByteThai, where coding meets cuisine in the heart of Bangkok! At ByteThai, we're more than just a
            restaurant. We're a culinary playground for tech enthusiasts and food lovers alike. Our story began with a
            group of passionate software engineers who shared a love for Thai food and a knack for coding. Inspired by
            our combined passions, we set out to create a dining experience like no other, where every dish is a work of
            art meticulously crafted with a touch of coding humor. From 'HTML Tom Yum Soup' to 'Python Panang Curry,'
            each menu item at ByteThai is a delicious fusion of traditional Thai recipes and modern coding concepts.
            Join us on a journey of flavor and innovation as we redefine the boundaries of Thai cuisine, one 'byte' at a
            time.</p>

        <h1>Origin Story</h1>
        <p>In the bustling streets of Bangkok, amidst the vibrant colors and tantalizing aromas of Thai cuisine, there
            emerged an innovative eatery unlike any other 'ByteThai'. Founded by a group of passionate tech enthusiasts
            with a deep love for Thai food, ByteThai was born from the fusion of two worlds: coding and culinary arts.
            The founders, hailing from diverse backgrounds in software engineering, shared a common dream to create a
            dining experience that marries the precision of coding with the creativity of cooking. Inspired by their
            love for both realms, they embarked on a journey to bring their vision to life.
            ByteThai's journey began in a small, cozy space adorned with sleek, minimalist decor reminiscent of a modern
            tech startup. Here, guests were welcomed into a world where every dish was crafted with the meticulous
            attention to detail of a seasoned programmer, yet bursting with the bold flavors and spices of traditional
            Thai recipes.
            From 'HTML Tom Yum Soup' to 'JavaScript Pad Thai' and 'Python Panang Curry', each dish on the menu was a
            culinary masterpiece infused with a hint of coding humor. As word of ByteThai spread, tech enthusiasts and
            foodies alike flocked to the restaurant, drawn by its unique concept and irresistible dishes.
            Over time, ByteThai grew into a beloved institution, known not only for its innovative approach to Thai
            cuisine but also for its warm hospitality and sense of community. Today, it stands as a symbol of
            creativity, passion, and the endless possibilities that arise when technology and tradition come together in
            perfect harmony.</p>
